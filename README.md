Checkpoint A - Project question(s) and dataset(s)

You need to start defining some important aspects that should drive your final project. Accordingly, this assignment has several questions and tasks that will get you started and working on your final project.

Business analytics projects have a practical goal that analysts try to reach or questions they try to answer. Accordingly, state one or two of the most important questions you are trying to answer in your business context with the final project.
Data is an essential element of analytics. Finding a good dataset can be challenging and requires some research. Therefore, do some initial exploration and find two or three sources of data that you plan to use; list at least two sources even if you have settled with one dataset.
To start planning the possible data analysis, create a table(s) that describes the datasets you plan to use. This table(s) should list all the columns you plan to use and provide a brief description of each column.
After finding the questions and datasets you plan to use, list three steps that you plan to take toward the final project.
Prepare a short presentation (5-8 minutes) to pitch your project idea to the class.

To submit your work, create a text document and submit your answers in an organized manner. I recommend that you export your text document to a PDF. Additionally, submit the slides you have prepared for your short presentation.

Checkpoint B - Initial descriptive analytics and predictive analytics plan 

At this checkpoint, you are asked to start working on your descriptive analytics and start a plan for executing your predictive analytics. The questions below will help you start working. Moreover, as your project continues to be developed, you should also be refined answers to checkpoint A. 

 What is the question(s) you are attempting to answer with your business analytics project?
 What is the dataset(s) will you use for your project?
 Provide a refined version of the table from checkpoint A that describes the columns of the datasets you plan to use. If you have not done so, add a column to describe the data type each column captures.
 Conduct an initial descriptive analysis. Identify five things your data has that need attention or are valuable to your project (e.g., problems, opportunities).
 Describe with bullet points your plan to conduct predictive analytics.
